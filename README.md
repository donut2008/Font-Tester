# Font-Tester
A simple app for testing fonts! :D

This is a swaggy little app that lets you test the fonts installed on your system :)

# How to install it though?
Make sure you unpacked the ZIP file in the releases section to its own folder.
1. open an administrator powershell window in the folder
2. type in / paste (exactly) ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted```
3. press A, and then Enter on your keyboard to allow for using third-party scripts.
4. open the ```Install.ps1``` file in PowerShell by typing in/pasting ```.\Install.ps1```
5. follow the instructions in the script
Good luck!
